A Selenium Data-Driven Project is an approach in which test data is separated from the test script, allowing for more flexibility and easier maintenance. The idea is to store test data externally, such as in a spreadsheet or database, and dynamically feed this data into the Selenium test script during execution. This approach is particularly useful when you need to execute the same test scenario with multiple sets of data.

Test Scenario:
Identify the test scenario that needs to be executed with different sets of data. This could be a login functionality, form submission, or any other operation you want to test.

Test Data:
Store the test data in an external source. JSON files Each row in the data source represents a set of input values for the test.

Test Script:
Write a Selenium test script in your preferred programming language Java

Data-Driven Framework:
Create a data-driven framework or modify your existing Selenium framework to incorporate the ability to read and use external test data. This involves establishing a connection to the data source, reading the data, and passing it to the test script.

Parameterization:
Parameterize the test script so that it can accept input from the external data source. Replace hard-coded values with variables or placeholders that will be dynamically populated during execution.

Test Execution:
Set up the test execution to iterate through the rows of the test data. For each iteration, feed the corresponding set of data into the test script. Execute the test scenario with different data sets to validate the application's behavior under various conditions.

Reporting:
Enhance your reporting mechanism to capture and log results for each iteration. This helps in identifying which sets of data passed or failed.

Maintenance:
Any changes to the test scenario or data can be made independently, reducing the effort required for maintenance. You can add or modify test data without modifying the actual test script.
